Most of the time when we describe "steepeners" or "flatteners" on the curve, we're talking about the yield curve. 
This is similar but we have an opinion on how near-term VIX futures will trade vs further dated futures. 
There was definitely better action on the Trump news last Friday, but the spread is still OK.
