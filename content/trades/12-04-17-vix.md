Most of the time when we describe "steepeners" or "flatteners" on the curve, we're talking about the yield curve. 
This is similar but we have an opinion on how near-term VIX futures will trade vs further dated futures.

There was some action on the Trump news last Friday, but the spread came back. It's a good time to reload at these levels. The 
short leg only has a few weeks left - so this is a very short term trade.

Remember, a point in the VIX is $1,000, so single lots of this calendar are large.
