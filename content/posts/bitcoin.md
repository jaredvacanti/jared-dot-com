Bitcoin crossed the $10,000 mark, and then a few hours later crossed the $9k mark, and then the $11k mark... but I don't think this volatility is bad.

<!--more-->

Actually, I think it's just a reflection of the state of the current market. 
The CME and CBOE are going to list bitcoin futures in the next few weeks and the primary
concern I hear is that they're too volatile. My questions about listing these products have nothing to do with their volatility.

These are financially settled products, so there isn't a problem with sourcing bitcoin to deliver. That might be hard if it was needed,
I don't really know.
What is interesting is the methodology they use to settle the price. Remember, bitcoin itself isn't traded at the CME, just the future.
The method now uses five exchanges in order to calculate a price. With the crazy price swings the last few days, there isn't enough
financial infrastructure in the space to keep the prices consistent across exchanges.

Either way, the introduction of these traditional trading vehicles to the bitcoin world will probably only *stabilize* the price. This is
because finance as an industry is supposed to be keeping prices in line... and now with being listed on the CME the industry may be
able to do just that.
