It doesn't matter how sophisticated of a model you use, when the VIX is trading at 9 *every model* says the same thing. It will revert.

There's an especially important fact: in order to have an opinion on the market you still have to make a trade. I was remineded of this
when discussing correlations with a friend. The only way to make a dispersion trade is *with the stocks that you can trade*. At the end
of the day, it is all long/short combinations of available positions.

I find that to be comforting. No matter how fancy a quant is getting, unless they're selling bespoke positions for a bank, they can only
trade with the available assets. There's no other way to express your opinion.
