All financial futures have a 'cost-of-carry', a natural repercussion of the marketplace that eliminates (as-usual) risk-free profit.

<!--more-->

Cost-of-carry is the financing costs it would require to hold the asset (or underlying assets) through the contract's expiration. 
Carry can be positive or negative, depending on the asset or commodity. Currently /ES has a small positive cost-of-carry, 
reflective of our very low interest rates. 

If you wanted to assemble the constituent stocks and hold them until expiration, 
you could finance the portfolio at these historically low interest rates. But-- that price has to be baked into the future somehow, 
otherwise you would do that, and you would buy the future and collect the difference! The marketplace eliminates that possibility.

How does the movement in financing impact the future movements of financial futures -- especially one regarded as so 
closely linked to the U.S. economy -- in particular crude oil. The carry on oil is both a function of supply & demand 
(as usual) and a function of storage costs. Storage can be explained as a supply & demand function, too. If storage 
is expensive, demand will increase today in order to decrease the need for it in the future (or a whole lot of other 
things can impact it more so it goes the other way).

Oil has recently gone into contango while being in backwardation from 2013. Does the implied financing rates have 
any indication of where the price of front-month oil is going to go? That's the question. As usual, we hypothesis 
no it does not, and see if we can't reject that hypothesis.
