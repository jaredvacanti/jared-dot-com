I'm the founder of <a href="https://noevate.org">Noevate</a>, the first enterprise introduction of the blockchain to real-world financial
markets. Every market participant can dynamically create, trade, and robustly clear *any* financial contract &#8212; bespoke or standard "vanillas"
&#8212; in any native currency.

I studied economics, mathematics, &amp; physics in school and have been doing either financial or economic research as a practitioner ever
since I left.

My first real job *after* school was at the University of Chicago's Department of Economics &amp; the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics
as a researcher. The timing &#8212; really only due to luck &#8212; could not have been better to be in Hyde Park.
Shortly after I arrived, the Nobel in Economics was awarded to Eugene Fama for the efficient market hypothesis. 
I wasn't working with the professors who won the awards (Lars Hansen also won that year) but I was 
able to participate &amp; observe the Chicago tradition of having the world's best economists converge on Chicago to question efficient markets. 
It's easier to say this in hindsight, but the aggresive questioning of this time-tested principle had undoubtedly impacted my economics.

After that, I worked at tastytrade &amp; tastyworks as a financial data scientist studying equity options &amp; futures. 
This is where I was able to develop my first local volatility models. 
These are the same models that eventually allowed me to focus solely on trading.
Although I trade very differently today than I did then, what I learned from Tom Sosnoff was my first practical introduction 
to *real-world* trading &amp; *real-world* risk.

I've been able to work on trading the yield curve and index options in very liquid products. Other than liquidity, I'm product
indifferent. Being able to trade this way has provided me a great deal of flexibility.

I don't believe I would have ever found myself traveling and trading as an academic researcher. I've learned more from the real traders
I've met in Chicago than I had from all of my professors before them. 


#### Education

- Creighton University - B.A. Economics (appointment in Physics)
- Depaul University - M.S. Mathematics (appointment in Economics)

Once Creighton joined the Big East, I had a conflict of interest... I cheer for the Bluejays.
