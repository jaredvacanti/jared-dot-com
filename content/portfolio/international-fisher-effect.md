I'm going to look at how expectations of inflation impact currency movements - or at least expected currency movements.

<!--more--> 
This is right along the lines of 
the International Fisher effect - if we can quantify interest rates and expectations as well as we can currently, there may be something to Federal 
Reserve policy and how it impacts tradeable currencies.

Current inflation is calculated with CPI numbers released by the CPI. If the real rate in country A is higher than the real rate in country B, it's 
expected that Country A's currency will depreciate against country B's.
